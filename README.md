## Overview

![main screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/ss/master/Shiba/shiba-screenshot.gif)

1. At start up, Shiba is watching the current working directory (the path is in title of window).
2. When you edit the markdown file in current working directory, Shiba finds the update, renders the file in window and sets the result of lint.
3. You can see the result of lint by clicking the '!' button in menu.  When the button is red, it means that linter reported some errors.
4. You can change the watching directory/file using 'directory' button in menu or dropping file to window.
5. You can quit app by closing the window.

This is the simplest use case.  Please see [usage document](docs/usage.md) for more detail.
