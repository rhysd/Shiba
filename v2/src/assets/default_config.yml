  # files and updates its preview when they are modified.
  file_extensions:
    - md
    - mkd
    - markdown
  # Throttle for debouncing file change events in milliseconds. This is useful to avoid the preview
  # repeatedly within very short span. This throttle is necessary since it is very common that text
  # editor modifies the file multiple times on saving.
  debounce_throttle: 50

# Key mappings. Keys are key binds and their values are corresponding actions to be bound. Any
# keymap sequences supported by mousetrap[1] are available for keys. Predefined action names are
# available for values.

# Configuration related to application window.
window:
  # Remember the window state (position, size, ...) and restore it when opening Shiba at next time.
  restore: false
  # Theme to apply to the application window. The following predefined values are available.

  # Application window is always on top of other windows.
  always_on_top: false
  # Default window size (width and height) in physical pixels. When `null` is set, the default window
  # size 800x600 pixels is used. When `restore` is set to `true` and there is a saved window state,
  # the window size in the state is used.
  # The following example creates a window with 1000x2000 pixels.
  #
  # ```
  # default_size:
  #   width: 1000
  #   height: 2000
  # ```
  default_size: null

# Configuration related to Markdown preview content.

  # Override CSS styles applied to Markdown preview with specified CSS file path. The path is

  # 1. Download `dark_dimmed.css`[1], dimmed version of GitHub Markdown CSS
  # 2. Put the downloaded file in the configuration directory
  # 3. Set `css: dark_dimmed.css` below
